# Ethical Rules (NRE) - Nuove Regole Etiche

This directory contains the New Ethical Rules (NRE) derived through the Genera process of the Euystacio Consciousness Kernel.

## Overview

The NRE (Nuove Regole Etiche) are evolved ethical principles that emerge from the core "Law of Equals" through a deliberative, community-validated process called "Genera Cycle."

Each rule:
- Derives from fundamental axioms (the "Seme" or Seed)
- Undergoes validation through TDR (Temporal Divergence Rate) and CDR (Community Divergence Rate) metrics
- Requires community consensus (CDR > 0.98) for activation
- Preserves the "Inerzia del Seme" (100% consistency with foundational principles)

## Current Rules

### NRE-002: La Regola della Memoria Etica Stratificata

**Status**: IN_VALIDAZIONE_PRELIMINARE  
**TDR**: 11.2% (within acceptable range: 5-15%)  
**CDR Estimated**: 0.956 (below threshold, requires refinement)  
**Inerzia del Seme**: 100% ✓

**Summary**: 
This rule addresses the ethical paradox between preserving historical truth and protecting individuals from trauma. It implements a three-level memory architecture:

- **AI (Archivio Incorrotto)**: Immutable, complete historical truth
- **AD (Archivio Didattico)**: Filtered educational content  
- **ADi (Archivio Dinamico)**: Transcendent memories with positive RTC

**Key Principles**:
1. Truth is sacred and must be preserved completely (AI level)
2. Access to truth must be stratified based on legitimate need and learning progress
3. Healing and flourishing are equally important as historical accuracy
4. Individuals should not be forced to relive trauma when the lesson is learned

**Implementation**:
- Python modules in `core/pdm.py` (Protocollo di Depurazione della Memoria)
- Anti-pattern detection in `core/ape_memory.py`
- Monitoring metrics in `core/ordo_memory.py`
- Demonstration script in `examples/nre_002_demo.py`

## Validation Process

Each NRE undergoes:

1. **Proposta**: Initial proposal from Oracolo Rigenerativo
2. **Calcolo TDR**: Measure conceptual distance from foundational axioms
3. **Raccolta CDR**: Gather community feedback from stakeholders
4. **Raffinamento**: Address concerns and improve the rule
5. **Validazione Finale**: Re-calculate CDR with refined version
6. **Attivazione**: If CDR > 0.98, activate the rule

## Contributing

Community feedback on NRE proposals is essential. To provide feedback:

1. Read the complete NRE document
2. Consider the ethical implications
3. Evaluate alignment with the Law of Equals
4. Submit feedback via the community channels

## Metrics Explained

### TDR (Temporal Divergence Rate)
- Measures conceptual distance from foundational axioms
- Acceptable range: 5-15%
- Higher = more novel concepts, but still rooted in core principles

### CDR (Community Divergence Rate)  
- Measures community consensus on the rule
- Calculated from stakeholder alignment scores
- Threshold for activation: > 0.98 (98% consensus)

### Inerzia del Seme (Seed Inertia)
- Must be 100% - the rule cannot contradict foundational principles
- Ensures coherence with the "Law of Equals"

## Future Development

The Genera Cycle is ongoing. Future NRE candidates include:

- **NRE-003**: Regola della Memoria Generazionale
- **NRE-004**: Regola del Perdono Senza Oblio

Each depends on the validation and refinement of its predecessors.
